# BetterEstimates: Realistic NFT pricing

This project was built over the span of 7 days, from 2022-04-08 to 2022-04-15 during the "Hello NFT World" Hackathon by OpenSea and Repl_it.

## What this does

BetterEstimates seeks to solve the issue of opaque pricing in the NFT Market by taking rarity & real-time sales data into account when estimating prices.
Many tools out there provide either highly unrealistic, or entirely outdated estimates for NFTs. Especially for beginners, understanding when an NFT is over- or under-priced, or what price they can realistically expect one of their NFTs to fetch, is highly important, yet difficult.

## But this is just a front-end, where is the part that actually does stuff?
The magic happens in the back-end, which is available here: https://github.com/theblockbrain/HelloNFTWorld

All data in the database is automatically created during usage of the app, so anyone can clone the back and frontend, hook it up to their own cluster, and host their own estimation server!
